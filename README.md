CS 3240: Languages and Computation
======
##Course Description
 One way to understand the fundamental structure, power and limitations of computation is through the study of decisi    on problems associated with various classes of languages. A language is an aggregate of strings from some alphabet,     and it can be characterized by giving a machine that discriminates or accepts those strings while rejecting all othe    rs. Alternatively, one can give a generative device or grammar capable of producing the strings in the language but     none of the others. The objective of this course is to learn these abstract languages and the computations inherent     to their corresponding machines and grammars. Scanners and parsers of compilers represent practical incarnations of     these theories. The limits of computability, Turing machines, decidability, and  reducibility will also be discussed    . The key objectives of this course are the following:

 1. in-depth understanding of computational powers of regular language, context-free languages, and Turing machines.

 2. understanding of some practical applications of regular and context-free languages;


 3. some problem solving by combining the two.
